Reem Kufi
=========

![Sample](documentation/ReemKufi-Sample.png)
Reem Kufi is a Fatimid-style decorative [Kufic] [1] typeface as seen in the
historical mosques of Cairo, and is largely based on the Kufic designs of
the late master of Arabic calligraphy [Mohammed Abdul Qadir] [2] who revived
this art in the 20th century and formalised its rules.

Reem Kufi is particularly suitable for display settings, in titles or
decorations. Due to its unmistakable old Kufic style, it gives a feeling of
something old, historical, or Islamic.

Some glyphs in Reem Kufi has several alternate variants that can work better
for different situations, they can be accessed with “Character Variant”
features (`cv01`, `cv02`, and so on).

Reem is an Arabic female name that literally means “a white deer” and it so
happens to be the name of my daughter.
